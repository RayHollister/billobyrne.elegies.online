            <p>Betty Collins passed away peacefully on February 9, 2024, in Jacksonville, Florida, just
                  days before turning 89.
                  Born in Jacksonville on February 12, 1935, she spent the majority of her life there. While most of her
                  life was
                  spent in Jacksonville, she also lived briefly in Palatka, Orlando, and Brunswick, Georgia. Despite
                  these moves,
                  Jacksonville was always her true home.</p>

                        class="db center mb4 fl w5-ns mr3-ns" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            </a>
            <p>Betty began her career at First Guaranty Bank before she had even graduated from Robert E. Lee High
                  School,
                  embarking on what would become a remarkable 38-year journey, during which she worked in multiple
                  departments
                  before retiring. Her tenure was not just long but historic, making her the bank's longest-serving
                  employee, a
                  badge of honor that reflected her unwavering commitment and dedication.</p>

            <p>Even after retirement, Betty maintained a strong connection with her former colleagues, gathering
                  annually to
                  reminisce about their shared experiences, showcasing her loyalty and the deep bonds formed throughout
                  her career.

            </a>

            <p>Betty's life was marked by her trailblazing spirit as a career woman during a time when it was not widely
                  accepted. Despite the controversy surrounding women in the workforce at the time, Betty prioritized
                  her
                  professional life. Yet, she deeply loved her family, considering her children, grandchildren, and
                  great-grandchildren among her proudest accomplishments and never hesitating to extend her care to
                  those in need.
            </p>

            <p>Following a severe car accident that rendered her sister Patricia unable to care for her child, Betty
                  unhesitatingly welcomed her niece Alison into her family, raising her as her own daughter. When her
                  son-in-law
                  Mark's parents were critically ill, Betty and her late husband Pat took on the care of their grandson
                  Brandon.
                  This not only offered Mark and Lynda the peace of mind needed to tend to Mark's parents in their last
                  days but
                  also fostered cherished memories for Brandon, particularly of tending to the fruit trees in the
                  backyard with
                  Betty. Betty even took a job as a crossing guard at his elementary school, ensuring she was there to
                  greet him
                  after school where he served on the safety patrol. Additionally, Betty provided unwavering support to
                  George, the
                  adopted son of her late husband Pat in Palatka, helping him navigate his journey with multiple
                  sclerosis.</p>

            <p>A gifted conversationalist, Betty made friends wherever she went, particularly at the Edgewood
                  Condominiums and
                  Silver Treasures at Lane Ave.</p>

            <p>Betty met Bill O'Byrne, the sunset love of her life, at the Florida Edgewood Condominiums, where their
                  love story
                  began with daily walks to the St. Johns River. Bill noticed Betty's unsteadiness and offered his hand,
                  a simple
                  act that marked the start of their companionship. Together, they delighted in feeding and naming the
                  squirrels
                  along their route, and their evenings were often spent in the quiet joy of assembling puzzles. These
                  shared
                  pleasures deepened their connection, weaving into the fabric of their twilight years together.</p>

                        <p>My grandmother Betty was a wonderful woman. She held family close to her heart and loved
                              being involved in our lives. She was there for many of my milestones including traveling
                              from Florida to Alabama to see me graduate high school as well as college.</p>
                        <p>I have so many memories and stories of her but my favorite is my grandmother playing
                              matchmaker. During her years at First Guaranty Bank, she worked with a nice woman named
                              Mary. Betty thought her son Steve would hit it off with her so she set them up on a blind
                              date. Next thing you know, they get married and have me. I love that I can thank my
                              grandmother as part of the reason I'm here today. It's a sentimental story for me and will
                              always have a special place in my heart.</p>
